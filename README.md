# C_Program_Array
1. Write a C program that declare an array length of one hundred (100) and initialize the array with ten (10) values. Then do the following operations. a. Print the array using loop. b. Insert any value at tenth (10.) index of the array. And print the whole array. c. Update fifth (5.) index with another value. And print the whole array. d. Search a value X (take input X from user) in the array and print the index if X found in the array otherwise print Not Found. e. insert a value Y (take input Y from user) in the array at third (31 index and shift all other value to right. And print the whole array. f. Delete a value from Zth index (take input Z from user) from the array shift all other value to left. And print the whole array. g. Write a recursive function to print the array. Call the function after the above operations. h. Write a recursive function to print the array in reverse order. Call the function after the above operations.
